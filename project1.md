## Project description

This is a Personal Calendar project built in Java to demonstrate a mastery of principles of Object Oriented Programming. The project is built to allow users to create, read, update, and delete time-based appointments and day-based events, including names, dates, and descriptions, as well as start and end times for time-based appointments. Furthermore, time-based appointments are validated against existing appointments to prevent overlap. This program is built as a command-line interface.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile and run the project:

Make sure you have the Java Development Kit on your device, then run the following:

```bash
cd ./Calendar;
javac *;
java CLI;
```

Alternatively, load the code into your preferred Java Development Environment and run!

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
