## Project description

This is a full-stack web application project utilizing React, Node.js, and Express.js to build a Forum for a possible senior project. Through this web application you can see recent updates on the project, download distributions of the project, and participate in forum-based discussions about the project through the creation and maintenance of a personal account.

## How to compile and run the program

To compile and run this project, you must have npm installed on your device, as well as nodemon. If you have a stable full-stack environment, then open two terminals and type the following commands:

```bash
cd server;
npm start;
```

```bash
cd client;
npm start;
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.

## 3. Additional Considerations

Note that npm distributions can be fickle. If the application does not run on your device, you may be required to create your own project environment. If so, you must copy ```clients/src/*``` into your own client directory, and ```server/*``` into your own server directory.
